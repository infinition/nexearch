# FluidLM Lab - Unified Launcher 
# =============================================================================
#
# This script orchestrates the two main processes of the FluidLM research lab:
#   1. The training engine  (train_engine.py)  - runs the PDE-based model
#   2. The research dashboard (web_app.py)     - Streamlit-based live telemetry
#
# Architecture choice: we use subprocess.Popen rather than multiprocessing
# because Streamlit needs its own process context (it spawns a Tornado server)
# and PyTorch's CUDA context doesn't play well with fork(). Two separate
# processes communicate via atomic JSON file writes - a deliberately simple
# IPC mechanism that avoids the complexity of sockets or shared memory while
# remaining robust to race conditions.
#
# The config.json file acts as a shared "blackboard" between the two processes:
# the dashboard writes hyperparameter changes, the engine reads them every
# ~10 optimizer steps. This polling approach adds negligible overhead (~0.1ms
# per read) and keeps both processes fully decoupled.
#
# Usage:
#   python launch_lab.py
#   Then navigate to http://localhost:8501

    Write JSON data to disk atomically using a temporary file + os.replace().

    Why atomic writes matter here:
    Both the training engine and the Streamlit dashboard read/write the same
    config file concurrently. A naive open()+write() could produce a half-
    written file that the other process reads, causing json.JSONDecodeError.
    The atomic write pattern (write to .tmp, then os.replace) guarantees that
    the target file is either the old version or the new version - never a
    partial/corrupted intermediate state.

    The retry logic handles rare filesystem contention on Windows (where
    os.replace can fail if the target is momentarily locked by another process).
