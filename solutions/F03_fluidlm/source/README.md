# FluidLM

**A Transformer-free language model replacing O(N^2) self-attention with reaction-diffusion PDEs -- achieving O(N) scaling, adaptive computation, and no KV-cache.**

> Early-stage proof of concept. The goal is to demonstrate that the mathematical framework is sound and the core mechanisms work -- not to compete with production LLMs.

## What is FluidLM?

FluidLM replaces the self-attention mechanism with a system of continuous partial differential equations (PDEs). Inspired by Alan Turing's 1952 work on morphogenesis, it treats tokens as chemical concentrations that diffuse and react in a latent space.

Instead of every token explicitly "looking at" every other token through an N x N matrix, information propagates through:

- **Local diffusion** -- a multi-scale Laplacian (dilations 1, 4, 16) that spreads information between neighbors, like heat through a medium.
- **Selective State Space (Mamba)** -- a content-based temporal routing mechanism that replaces the previous fixed CausalLongConv. Each token selectively retains or forgets information based on its content, providing the content-aware long-range mixing that pure diffusion lacks.
- **Reaction MLP (SwiGLU)** -- the nonlinear component where all semantic capacity is concentrated.
- **Global memory pump** -- a reservoir `h` of shape `(B, D)` with learned forget gate that accumulates a sequence summary.

This shift from "every token talks to every token" to "information flows like a fluid" eliminates quadratic complexity.

## 1. Motivation

### The O(N^2) Attention Wall

Self-attention computes pairwise interactions between every token. For a sequence of N tokens, this produces an N x N matrix -- **O(N^2) computational and memory complexity**. Doubling context quadruples cost.

### Static Computation

A Transformer applies exactly L layers to every input, whether it is processing "Hello" or a complex mathematical proof.

### The KV-Cache Memory Wall

During inference, Transformers store Key and Value matrices for every past token in every layer. This cache grows with sequence length x layer count -- tens of gigabytes for long-context models.

### GPU Dependency

The combination of O(N^2) compute, large KV-caches, and irregular memory access makes Transformers fundamentally GPU-dependent. Their patterns are poorly suited for CPUs, NPUs, and embedded processors.

FluidLM asks: **what if we replaced the attention matrix entirely with a different mathematical object?**

---

## 2. The FluidLM Approach

Two complementary propagation mechanisms replace global attention:

**Local diffusion** -- the multi-scale Laplacian propagates information from neighbor to neighbor at three spatial scales (dilations 1, 4, 16). Each token influences its immediate neighborhood; patterns emerge globally through repeated application.

**Selective State Space (Mamba)** -- V4.5.0 replaces the fixed CausalLongConv filter with a Mamba-style selective SSM. This is the key architectural upgrade: while the Laplacian provides position-based spatial mixing, the SSM provides content-based temporal routing. The SSM's input-dependent matrices (A, B, C) allow the model to selectively retain or discard information based on what the token contains -- the missing capability that caused the previous loss plateau at ~6.0.

**Memory pump** -- a global reservoir `h` of shape `(B, D)` that accumulates a sequence summary at each integration step, then broadcasts it uniformly to all positions. The **Forget Gate** (`decay = sigmoid(decay_param)`) introduces learned viscosity: the model learns what persists in the reservoir and what dissipates. The gate is h-aware (`sigmoid(Wx + Uh)`) to avoid accumulating what is already present.

**Laplacian smoothness regularizer** (V4.4.8, ported from FluidWorld) -- a grad_loss term computed on the final hidden representation penalizes high-frequency noise along the sequence dimension. This acts as an implicit spatial regularizer that improves autoregressive generation stability.

---

## 3. Mathematical Foundations

### The Standard Transformer (what we replace)

$$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{Softmax}\!\left(\frac{Q \cdot K^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) \cdot V$$

The product $Q \cdot K^\top$ produces the $N \times N$ attention matrix -- the source of $O(N^2)$ complexity.

### The FluidLM Governing Equation

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \underbrace{\sum_{k} D_k \cdot \nabla^2_{d_k}(u)}_{\text{local diffusion}} + \underbrace{\text{SSM}(u)}_{\text{content-based routing}} + \underbrace{R(u, \theta)}_{\text{reaction (SwiGLU)}} + \underbrace{\alpha \cdot h}_{\text{global memory}}$$

#### Term 1: Multi-Scale Local Diffusion

The discrete Laplacian $[1, -2, 1]$ applied at three dilation levels:

| Dilation | Reach per step | Role |
|----------|----------------|------|
| 1 | ~1 token | Local syntax, morphology |
| 4 | ~4 tokens | Phrase-level structure |
| 16 | ~16 tokens | Sentence / paragraph |

$O(N)$ per step, sequential memory access -- ideal for CPU SIMD.

#### Term 2: Selective State Space (Mamba)

$$h_t = \bar{A}_t \cdot h_{t-1} + \bar{B}_t \cdot x_t$$

$$y_t = C_t \cdot h_t + D \cdot x_t$$

Where $A$, $B$, $C$ are **input-dependent** (computed from the current token). This is mathematically a discretized ODE -- the same family as the PDE diffusion. The SSM selectively chooses what to remember and what to forget based on content, providing the content-based routing that pure diffusion lacks.

Pure PyTorch implementation (no custom CUDA kernels). $O(N \cdot d \cdot s)$ training, $O(d \cdot s)$ constant per-token inference. No KV-cache.

#### Term 3: Reaction Function (SwiGLU)

$$R(u, \theta) = \left(W_1 \cdot u \odot \sigma(W_g \cdot u)\right) \cdot W_2$$

SwiGLU (V4.5.0) replaces the previous GELU MLP. Proven by LLaMA/PaLM to improve language modeling quality. $\frac{8}{3}$ expansion ratio.

#### Term 4: Global Memory Pump + Forget Gate

$$s = \text{mean}_{L}(R(u)) \quad \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times D}$$

$$g = \sigma(W_x \cdot \bar{u} + W_h \cdot h) \quad \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times D}$$

$$\delta = \sigma(\theta_{\text{decay}}) \quad \in (0,1)^{D} \quad \text{(learned viscosity)}$$

$$h \leftarrow \delta \odot h + g \cdot \tanh(s)$$

$h$ is of shape $(B, D)$ -- global reservoir, $O(1)$ memory. Initialized at $\text{decay} \approx 0.97$.

#### Term 5: Laplacian Grad Loss (V4.4.8)

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{grad}} = w_g \cdot \text{mean}\!\left(|\nabla^2_{1D}(z_{\text{final}})|\right)$$

Applied to the final hidden representation $z_{\text{final}}$ before the LM head. Penalizes second-order discontinuity along the sequence, encouraging smooth latent representations that degrade gracefully during autoregressive generation.

### Positional Encoding: Sinusoidal

Applied once at the FluidNet input (not at each integration step):

$$PE_{(pos, 2i)} = \sin\!\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d}}\right), \quad PE_{(pos, 2i+1)} = \cos\!\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d}}\right)$$

Sinusoidal encoding gives a clean additive signal that propagates naturally through the PDE.

### Time Integration (Forward Euler)

$$u_{t+1} = \text{RMSNorm}\!\left( u_t + \Delta t \cdot \left[ \sum_k D_k \nabla^2_{d_k}(u_t) + \text{SSM}(u_t) + R(u_t,\theta) + \alpha \cdot h_t \right] \right)$$

$\Delta t$ is a per-layer learned parameter (`dt_gate`), initialized from the config `dt` value.

### Turing Equilibrium and Adaptive Computation

$$\tau = \text{mean}\left(\frac{|u_{t+1} - u_t|}{|u_t| + \varepsilon}\right) \xrightarrow{< \varepsilon} \text{HALT}$$

During inference, the model halts early when the fluid stabilizes. During training, turbulence contributes to a differentiable regularization loss.

### What FluidLM Trades Away

- **Proven scaling laws.** Not empirically characterized beyond 44M params.
- **Ecosystem maturity.** No FlashAttention, speculative decoding, or equivalent.
- **Production validation.** Research prototype, not battle-tested.

---

## 7. Research Dashboard

The Streamlit dashboard provides real-time visibility into training.

```bash
python launch_lab.py
# -> http://localhost:8501
```

**Header bar:** step, loss (with delta), adaptive effort (avg_steps/max), speed, VRAM, ETA, main CE, eq loss, turbulence, actual cosine-decayed LR, tokens seen, epoch.

**Loss curve:** total loss, main CE, eq loss, grad_loss, actual LR on secondary axis.

**Turing Waves heatmap:** activation magnitude across positions and integration steps. Toggle "Norm rows" for per-row normalization.

**Effort trend:** avg_steps over time with turbulence on secondary axis and epsilon threshold line.

**Sidebar dt:** shows the actual learned dt per layer. The slider sets the initialization point; the model adapts from there.

**Auto-Pilot:** automatic loop detection and plateau-based LR decay.

---

## 8. Experimental Status

### What Has Been Demonstrated

1. **The architecture trains and converges.** Loss ~10.8 -> 5.85 on TinyStories.
2. **Linear memory scaling.** VRAM scales linearly with sequence length.
3. **Adaptive computation works mechanically.** Convergence criterion fires correctly at inference.
4. **O(1) memory pump confirmed.** 128x less VRAM than the (B,L,D) variant.

### What Has NOT Been Demonstrated

1. Competitive perplexity against equivalent Transformers.
2. Adaptive compute correlating with input difficulty (formal proof pending).
3. Scaling behavior at 100M+ parameters.
4. Whether V4.5.0 (SSM + SwiGLU) breaks through the ~6.0 loss plateau.

### Known Limitations

- Forward Euler is first-order and conditionally stable (RK4 planned).
- h-state resets every forward pass -- no inter-sequence memory.
- Generation quality at ~44M params is not representative of the architecture's ceiling.
